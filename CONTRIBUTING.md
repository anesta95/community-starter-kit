### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: These are projects that are still under-development and open-source assistance is still needed to finish the program so that it can be added to the final bot.
- **qa-needed**: Quality assistance is needed to put on finishing touches on this project.
- **documentation-needed**: These points in the project need documentation to assist open-source users in the correct way to efficiently contribute bug-fixes, edits, and pull-request additions.
- **bug-high-priority**: _Anything_ that impeades the core functionality of the automation of GitHub tasks
- **bug-low-priority**: All other bugs that may degrade other 
- **help-wanted**: Please if you have any experience in web-development or higher-level programmers.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
